It's one of those things I could maybe use more often...

  Sorry your browser does not support the video tag, maybe time to upgrade?
</video>

Install with `M-x package-install RET undo-tree`

To turn on timestamps put this in your `.emacs.d` config.

{% highlight elisp %}
(setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
{% endhighlight %}

BTW undo-tree-visualizer is part of the standard Spacemacs config, timestamps are already
switched on, with key bindings <kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>u</kbd> to launch it.
